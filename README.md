FreeThrowMerchant(FTM) makes it easier to find the NBA stats you need, from the comfort of your own Discord server. The bot provides easy access to digestible player information and game status through intuitive commands.

### State of FTM (updated 9/18)

While FTM is currently a bot tailored to my friends and I in our private server, my plan is to eventually scale it up for general use in any servers that would appreciate easy-access NBA stats and other information.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to FreeThrowMerchant that are inconsideration.

- Access specific free throw statistics and display in a digestible format.


### Thanks/Credits

- A big thank you to [Under Ctrl](https://www.youtube.com/@UnderCtrl) on YouTube for guidance on the basics of Discord.js.
