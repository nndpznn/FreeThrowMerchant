FreeThrowMerchant(FTM) makes it easier to find the NBA stats you need, from the comfort of your own Discord server. The bot provides easy access to digestible player information and game status through intuitive commands.

### State of FTM (updated 9/18)

FTM started as a pet project for me to try my hand at user interaction with JavaScript, and is currently a bot tailored to my friends and I in our private server. My plan is to eventually scale it up for general use in any servers that would appreciate easy-access NBA stats and other information.

### To-Dos

Some ideas of possible additions/changes to FreeThrowMerchant that are in consideration.
- Access specific free throw statistics and display in a digestible format.
- Multiple-choice trivia game!


### Thanks/Credits
